# Discourse

**Definition:**  
A system of thought, knowledge, or communication that shapes what can be said, thought, or perceived as truth within a given historical or social context.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Power-Knowledge:** Discourse both produces and is produced by power relations, creating regimes of truth that determine what is considered legitimate knowledge.  
- **Historical Contingency:** Discursive formations are not universal but emerge from specific historical and cultural contexts, often shifting over time.  
- **Institutional Reinforcement:** Discourses are maintained through institutions (medical, legal, educational) that validate certain statements while excluding others.
