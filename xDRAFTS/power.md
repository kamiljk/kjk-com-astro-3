**Definition:**  
Power is not a possession but a relation, circulating through networks of discourse, institutions, and practices that shape behavior, knowledge, and subjectivity.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Productive Force:** Power doesn't just repress; it produces reality, domains of objects, and rituals of truth through knowledge systems.  
- **Capillary Nature:** Power functions not only from top-down authority but through diffuse, everyday interactions, creating self-regulating subjects.  
- **Resistance:** Where power exists, resistance necessarily co-exists as an inseparable counterpart, operating in the same network of relations.
