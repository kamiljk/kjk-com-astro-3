**Definition**  
Whisper networks are informal, often secretive systems of communication where individuals share information, warnings, or gossip that exists in liminal spaces between recognized formal systems.

**Key Attributes**  
- **Secrecy and Subversion:** Rely on covert communication protected through trust and intimacy, allowing for subversion of mainstream narratives or power structures.  
- **Power and Resistance:** Function as counterpoints to established power dynamics, providing spaces where marginalized or silenced voices can assert agency and influence.  
- **Fluidity and Ambiguity:** Unlike formal systems, whisper networks are fluid and can adapt to changing conditions, with information that can be ambiguous and open to interpretation.
