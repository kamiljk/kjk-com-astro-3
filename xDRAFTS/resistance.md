**Definition:**  
Resistance exists in the thresholds of power as a fluid, contested, and transitional force that both disrupts and reconfigures dominant structures through subversion, adaptation, and rearticulation.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Immanence to Power:** Resistance is never in a position of exteriority to power but emerges from within the same networks of relations.  
- **Multiform Tactics:** Manifests through active opposition (protest, sabotage), passive defiance (strikes, boycotts), and symbolic expressions (art, language).  
- **Rhizomatic Structure:** Operates through decentralized, non-hierarchical forms that spread in unpredictable ways rather than through centralized leadership.
