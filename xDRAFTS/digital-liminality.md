**Definition:**  
Digital liminality refers to the threshold experiences and in-between states that occur in virtual environments, where identity, community, and space exist between material reality and algorithmic construction.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Virtual Presence:** Digital spaces create unique states of being present-but-absent, enabling simultaneous existence in multiple contexts and communities.  
- **Identity Fluidity:** Online personas allow for experimentation with identity performance unconstrained by physical embodiment or consistent presentation.  
- **Code/Culture Interface:** The intersection of technical infrastructure and cultural practice creates new forms of social organization, governance, and expression.
