# Bias

**Definition:**  
Biases act as invisible forces that guide perception, reinforce or disrupt established truths, functioning as boundary mechanisms determining what is sayable, thinkable, or acceptable within contexts.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Systemic Reinforcement:** Biases are not just personal tendencies but systemic reinforcements of dominant ideologies embedded in discursive regimes.  
- **Algorithmic Embedding:** Automated bias shapes discourse through platforms, creating liminal spaces between human and machine judgment.  
- **Contestation:** Competing biases struggle for dominance, exposing latent structural assumptions in systems of knowledge and power.
