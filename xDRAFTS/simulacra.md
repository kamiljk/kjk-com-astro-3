**Definition:**  
Baudrillard's concept of representations that no longer refer to any reality but form self-contained systems of signs creating hyperreality.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Progressive Detachment:** Evolves from reflecting reality to masking reality's absence  
- **Self-Referential System:** Signs refer only to other signs rather than external reality  
- **Hyperreality:** Creates an experience more compelling than the original it replaces
