# Asynchronicity

**Definition:**  
Operations that unfold independently of real-time synchronization, allowing for decentralization, delayed responses, and parallel processing.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Temporal Independence:** Events occur without requiring simultaneous coordination  
- **Distributed Function:** Enables separate components to operate autonomously  
- **Efficiency Through Separation:** Reduces coordination costs by allowing independent action
