# Spectrum-of-agency

**Definition:**  
The spectrum of agency conceptualizes the capacity to act, choose, or influence outcomes as a dynamic continuum rather than a binary state, operating within liminal spaces between control and autonomy.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Contextual Choice-Making:** Agency always occurs within a context (cultural, social, technological) that shapes possibilities and constraints.  
- **Role Plurality:** Individuals move along a spectrum of roles (observer, witness, catalyst, rebel) depending on context and power dynamics.  
- **Interdependence:** Agency is relational, meaning an individual's actions are influenced by their environment, other actors, and existing structures.
