# Temporality

**Definition**  
The experience and structure of time as a fluid, relational construct rather than fixed dimension, exploring how moments, memories, and futures intersect and blur.

**Key Attributes**  
- **Subjective Experience:** Personal perception of time's flow varies dramatically  
- **Cultural Construction:** Social and ritual practices shape temporal experience  
- **Multiple Temporalities:** Linear, cyclical, and disjointed time coexist
