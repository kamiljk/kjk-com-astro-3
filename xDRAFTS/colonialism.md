**Definition:**  
Colonialism operates as a liminal force at the intersection of multiple overlapping spaces between colonizer and colonized, between traditional and imposed structures, creating a threshold where cultural identities, power dynamics, and societal norms are contested.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Cultural Erasure & Hybridization:** The suppression or transformation of indigenous cultures through assimilation, education, and religious conversion creates liminal cultural identities.  
- **Threshold State:** Colonial spaces are zones of constant struggle, negotiation, and transformationâ€”neither fully integrated nor completely separate.  
- **Power & Authority:** The hierarchical imposition of control creates a liminal space where resistance and subversion continually redefine boundaries of agency.
