**Definition:**  
The Real Housewives franchise exists in a liminal space between reality and performance, authenticity and artifice, power and precarity, constructing a heightened version of domesticity, femininity, and wealth.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Hyperreality:** Housewives exist in a Baudrillardian simulacrum where performance supersedes reality; their lives are curated for entertainment but perceived as "real."  
- **Liminal Identity:** Participants are neither fully private individuals nor wholly public figures, occupying a transitional role blending personal narrative with strategic self-branding.  
- **Power & Gender:** The show performs exaggerated femininity, simultaneously reinforcing and contesting traditional gender roles through conspicuous consumption, conflict, and agency.
