# Autonomous-zones

**Definition:**  
Autonomous zones are spaces that exist outside or in defiance of state control, economic structures, and dominant social orders where alternative ways of organizing power, labor, and life emerge.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Temporary vs. Permanent:** Some zones exist briefly (protests, occupations), while others persist (communes, anarchist zones), creating liminal spaces between fleeting rebellion and sustained governance.  
- **Self-Governance:** Rejects hierarchical rule in favor of collective decision-making, consensus processes, and direct democracy.  
- **Spatial & Digital Manifestations:** Exists both in physical territories (occupied spaces, protest zones) and digital networks (encrypted platforms, decentralized communities).
