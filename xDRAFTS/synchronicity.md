# Synchronicity

**Definition:**  
The meaningful coincidence of events that appear connected despite lacking causal links, suggesting patterns beyond conventional understanding.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Acausal Connection:** Relationships without direct cause-effect mechanisms  
- **Meaningful Alignment:** Subjective significance attached to coincidental events  
- **Pattern Recognition:** Reveals connections typically obscured by rationalist frameworks.
