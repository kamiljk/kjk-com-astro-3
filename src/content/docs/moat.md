**Definition:**  
A liminal barrier that both contains and isolates, marking the space between insiders and outsiders while creating power asymmetry through controlled access and mobility.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Containment vs. Confinement:** Creates a space of stability and protection but also limits freedom and mobility for those within its boundaries.  
- **Walled Gardens:** Functions as an enclosed ecosystem (physical or digital) where access is controlled and curated, limiting interaction with external environments.  
- **Buffer & Boundary:** Acts as a protective layer that prevents free flow of resources, information, or people while defining who can move and who cannot.
