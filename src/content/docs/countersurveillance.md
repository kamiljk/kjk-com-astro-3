**Definition:**  
Countersurveillance encompasses tactics that disrupt the enforced visibility of individuals by power structures through obfuscation, camouflage, and subversion, creating liminal states between visibility and disappearance.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Face & Gait Obfuscation:** Techniques that confuse biometric tracking via masks, adversarial clothing, and movement disruption, rendering AI-driven surveillance ineffective.  
- **Digital Anonymity:** Using VPNs, Tor, burner phones, and encryption to erase digital footprints, operating in the liminal space between identity and disinformation.  
- **Behavioral Camouflage:** Strategic adaptation of neutral clothing, pattern avoidance, and crowd-blending to exist between presence and indistinctiveness.
