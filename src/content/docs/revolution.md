**Definition:**  
Revolution is a rupture in the order of things, a liminal passage between one regime and another that fundamentally reorders meaning, structure, and power.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Threshold State:** Marks the liminal moment where the existing system is no longer stable but the new order has yet to fully materialize.  
- **Multi-dimensional Change:** Not merely political but encompasses social, technological, epistemic, and aesthetic dimensions of transformation.  
- **Cyclical Nature:** Revolutions transform, mutate, and re-emerge, often reproducing elements of the systems they sought to dismantle.
