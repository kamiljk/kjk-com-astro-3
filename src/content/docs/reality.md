**Definition:**  
In the context of liminality, reality is not a fixed or objective state but a fluid assemblage of perceptions, truths, and power structures that occupies the threshold between known and unknown, stable and contested.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Consensus vs. Dissensus:** Reality exists between collective agreement and competing interpretations, creating zones of contestation.  
- **Hyperreality:** The postmodern condition blurs distinctions between the simulation and the original, where representations replace direct experience.  
- **Power-Knowledge Nexus:** What counts as "real" is shaped by dominant knowledge structures and authority, making reality inherently political.
