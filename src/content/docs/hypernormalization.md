**Definition:**  
A paradoxical state where a system becomes so saturated with contradictions that both authorities and citizens participate in its artificial reality despite knowing it's false.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Collective Pretense:** Widespread acknowledgment of falsehood alongside continued participation  
- **Simulated Reality:** Official narratives diverge increasingly from lived experience  
- **Inertial Stability:** Perpetuates itself through resignation rather than belief
