**Definition:**  
The Bachelor/Bachelorette franchise functions as a ritualized liminal event where contestants transition from obscurity to temporary celebrity while love is packaged, optimized, and sold as spectacle rather than authentic connection.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Orchestrated Scarcity:** Love is framed as a high-stakes competition where artificial shortage of affection forces contestants into emotional performativity.  
- **Perpetual Liminality:** The show thrives by ensuring no resolution is final, with breakups, spin-offs, and reboots keeping contestants trapped in an endless cycle of deferred satisfaction.  
- **The Instagramification of Romance:** Success is measured not by love but by post-show brand deals and follower counts, converting reality TV fame into market viability.
