**Definition:**  
Consensus and dissensus represent dynamic interplay within liminal spaces, where collective agreement on norms, values, or truth conditions confronts disruption and alternative logics.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Consensus as Ordering Mechanism:** Functions to stabilize systems but relies on strategic forgetting and erasure of alternative narratives.  
- **Dissensus as Rupture:** Emerges when marginalized perspectives create breaks in the dominant order, exposing its constructed nature.  
- **Power Negotiation:** The tension between consensus and dissensus shapes the distribution of the sensible—what can be perceived, thought, and articulated within a community.
