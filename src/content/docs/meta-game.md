**Definition:**  
Meta game theory explores the strategic layer of play or decision-making beyond explicit, surface-level rules, concerned with how participants navigate transitions, shifting boundaries, and hidden power dynamics.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Hidden Rules & Unspoken Norms:** The meta game thrives in spaces between formal and informal rules, where players strategically exploit or subvert unspoken dynamics.  
- **Fluidity of Contexts:** Operates in constantly shifting landscapes where goalposts move as players adapt and change tactics.  
- **Strategic Power Play:** Involves understanding and manipulating larger forces, including alliances, resources, and timing beyond individual interactions.
