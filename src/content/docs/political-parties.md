**Definition:**  
Political parties exist in a liminal state between institutions of governance and autonomous actors, mediating between state power and public sentiment as both gatekeepers and conduits of political transformation.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Structure vs. Fluidity:** Parties oscillate between rigid bureaucratic organization and flux (coalition-building, policy shifts, populist reorientations).  
- **Identity Formation:** Party ideology functions as a constructed, evolving narrative that shapes both internal cohesion and external perception.  
- **Boundary Work:** Parties constantly negotiate inclusion/exclusion of members, factions, and dissidents, defining the limits of acceptable political discourse.
