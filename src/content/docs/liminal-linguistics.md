**Definition:**  
Liminal linguistics examines how language operates in the in-between spaces where meaning is made, unmade, or contested, focusing on how words construct, challenge, or transform social reality through thresholds.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Prefixes & Suffixes:** Greek and Latin affixes function as building blocks that shape how we conceptualize mindsets, power, transformation, and fearâ€”key forces in liminal spaces.  
- **Mirror Pairs:** Oppositional affixes (e.g., philia/phobia, homo/hetero) reveal linguistic tensions that mark thresholds of meaning.  
- **Slang & Secret Codes:** Language positioned on cultural thresholds that functions as a marker of belonging or exclusion, reinforcing in-group/out-group boundaries.
