**Definition:**  
Heterotopias are real places that function as "counter-sites" or "effectively enacted utopias" where other social spaces are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Juxtaposition:** Heterotopias bring together multiple incompatible spaces within a single real place (e.g., gardens containing plants from different ecosystems).  
- **Temporal Disruption:** They often involve breaks with traditional time, either accumulating time (museums, libraries) or existing as fleeting moments (festivals, vacations).  
- **Systems of Opening/Closing:** Entry to heterotopias is controlled through rituals, purifications, or other mechanisms that both isolate and make them penetrable.
