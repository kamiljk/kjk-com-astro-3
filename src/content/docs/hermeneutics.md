**Definition:**  
The interpretive practice of meaning-making at thresholds between understanding and misunderstanding, examining how interpretation itself produces liminal conditions.

- **Circularity:** Understanding operates through cycles of context and detail  
- **Historicity:** Interpretation always occurs within temporal and cultural situations  
- **Contestedness:** Acknowledges competing interpretations as inevitable
